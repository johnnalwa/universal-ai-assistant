A **decentralized personal AI assistant** that builds and maintains a comprehensive knowledge graph about you, running entirely on the Internet Computer Protocol. Unlike traditional AI that forgets everything between sessions, Universal AI Assistant creates a permanent, growing digital memory that learns your preferences, remembers your context, and becomes more intelligent with every interaction.

## 💬 Usage Examples

### First Conversation
```
User: "Hi there!"

Universal AI: "Hello! I'm your Universal AI Assistant that learns and 
remembers everything about you. What should I call you?"

User: "Call me Sarah. I'm a frontend developer working on a React project."

Universal AI: "Nice to meet you, Sarah! 🎉 I've noted that you're a frontend 
developer working with React. I'll remember this for all our future 
conversations. What kind of React project are you building?"
```

### Later Conversation (Weeks Later)
```
User: "I'm having trouble with state management"

Universal AI: "Hi Sarah! Are you referring to state management in that React 
project you mentioned when we first met? Based on our previous conversations, 
I know you're a frontend developer. Are you looking at Redux, Context API, 
or perhaps Zustand for this project?"

User: "Actually, it's a new project. A startup idea I'm working on."

Universal AI: "Exciting! 🚀 I'll remember this new startup project. Is this 
related to your React expertise, or are you exploring different technologies? 
I'd love to learn more about your goals with this startup."
```

### Intelligent Inquiry in Action
```
User: "Help me with the authentication bug"

Universal AI: "I'd love to help! I remember you're working on both your original 
React project and a new startup. Which project is experiencing the 
authentication issue? Also, what authentication method are you using - 
JWT, OAuth, or something else? This context will help me give you the most 
relevant solution."
```

## 🛠️ Technical Infrastructure
